# seaborn-customer-heatmap-tds
This repository contains my TDS assignment where I built a Seaborn-based customer engagement heatmap using synthetic data. It includes chart.py for generating the visualization, a 512×512 chart.png export, and a README with my email for validation. The project follows Seaborn best practices for professional analytics.
